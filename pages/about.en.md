### Who am I

My name is Felipe Bandeira, I'm a very lucky brazilian developer. I say that because I had the luck to find the love of my life at quite a young age (13 years old), even though we would only meet and marry at 22 (she is the first person I talked to, online). I'm the father of three loving and full of energy kids. I have a few friends that I can trust, and not long ago I found the job that made me stop hating mondays. Those are the most precious things in my life, and I consider myself extremely lucky because of them.

### My background

My first contact with computers happened  when I was 8, my aunt gave my family an x286 computer, where I learned the basics of the command line. A few years later we bought an x586 with Win95, and after getting into trouble a few times for corrupting the system, I learned how to format a computer. I still remember the feeling of relief, happiness and boldness. My first contact with programming happened when I was learning how to use EasyUO, a macroing tool for Ultima Online, the first MMORPG I played. I didn't know it at the time, and it took me several years to find out, but the scripts I used to create were procedural programming scripts, and I loved to create them and let the computer work for me.

I didn't always work as a developer, I worked at many different industries (food, chemical, retail, aviation, and a few more) and roles before. Life wasn't easy and I had to take the best job I could, it didn't matter if I enjoyed it or not. I did several gigs as an IT technician, formatting, setting up networks, upgrading hardware, etc. This experience taught me to see things from different perspectives, and with that, I developed a lot my empathy and conflict management skills, which are very useful as a dad of three kids! I also learned a lot about respect, responsibility and especially teamwork, even when you're not really in a team, I mean, two or more persons working at the same place, they could work together, they can help each other, even in different roles or at different companies.

### Why the blog

This blog is the solution I found for a few objectives I had in mind:

- Create a 'repository' of things learned: not something like git, but a tool that would allow me to record my explanation about how I figured out a certain problem, creating my own 'virtual rubber duck'. I also wanted to be able to group the information in topics, so I could keep it organized and check it later, checking my evolution and understanding more about my learning process.
- Contribute to the tech community: explain concepts differently, under a new perspective, share specific problems that took me a long time researching (and usually required some tweaks on the solution, took some more time); share what I've learned and help others.
- Improve my writing skill: today I mostly code, and I used to write a lot, like letters, thoughts, etc. I miss that and was looking for a way to get back at it, also improving my communication.

I considered creating a YouTube channel, but that's not for me (maybe in the future). The catch is when we run into a problem and that red light is flashing in our face, is practically impossible to find a solution in a generic video title, in these cases, the good old text is unbeatable, so the blog was the chosen one. :)
