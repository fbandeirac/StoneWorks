### Who am I

My name is Felipe Bandeira, I'm a very lucky brazilian developer. I say that because I had the luck to find the love of my life at quite a young age (13), even though we would only meet and marry at 22 (she is the first person I talked to online). I'm the father of three loving and energetic kids. I have a few friends that I can really trust, and not long ago I found the job that's not really a job to me. Those are the most precious things in my life, and I consider myself extremely lucky because of them.

### My background

My first contact with computers happened  when I was 8, my auntie gave my family a x286 computer, where I learned the basics of command line. A few years later we bought a x586 with Win95, and after getting into trouble a few times for corrupting the system, I learned how to format a computer, I still remember the feeling of relief, happiness and boldness. My first contact with programming happened when I was learning how to use EasyUO, a macroing tool for Ultima Online, the first MMORPG I played. I didn't know it at the time, actually it took me several years to find out, but the scripts I used to create were procedural programming scripts, and I loved to create them and let the computer work for me.

I didn't always worked as a developer, I worked at many different industries and roles before (food, chemical, retail, aviation, and a few more). Life wasn't easy and I had to take the best job I could, it didn't matter what I had to do. I did several gigs as IT technician, formatting, setting up networks, upgrading hardware, etc.This background taught me to see things from different perspectives, and with that I developed a lot my empathy and conflict management skills, which are very usefull as a dad of three kids! I also learned a lot about respect, responsibility and team work, even when you're not really in a team, I mean, two or more persons working at the same place, they may be a team, they can help each other, even with different roles, even in different companies.

### Why the blog?

This blog is the solution I found for a few objectives I had in mind:

- Create a repository to analyze my code evolution: in a manner that I could group them, I wanted to pratice and refactor it later, better understanding and improving my learning process.
- Contribute to the tech comunity: maybe explaining something in a different way, under a new perspective; maybe posting about a specific problem I've ran into, that required a lot of research (and probably some tweaks on the solution, which itself required even more research); share what I've learned, and with a bit of luck, help someone.
- Improve my writing skill: I used to write a lot, today i pratically only code. I was searching for a way to write again, and hopefuly, improve my communication.

I thought about creating a youtube chanel, but that's not for me (maybe in the future). The catch is, when we run into a problem and that red light is flashing in our face, is practically impossible to find a solution in a generic video title, in these cases, the good ol' text is unbeatable, so the blog was the choosen one. :)
